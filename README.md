# STM32CubeExpansion_LED1642_V1.2.0
Cube Expansion for LED1642 driver from STMicrolecetronics

This software package is an expansion for STM32Cube, associated for X-NUCLEO-LED1642GW expansion board. As such, the source code included in this package runs on any STM32Nucleo board, when it is equipped with LED1642GW. The source code of this package is based on STM32Cube to ease portability across different STM32 MCU families.

X-CUBE-LED1642 software features:

        Complete package to build applications using LED1642GW
        Easy portability across different MCU families thanks to STM32Cube
        Sample application to demonstrate several LED pattern
        Various functions available for controlling LED pattern
        Free user-friendly license terms
        Example implementation available for X-CUBE-LED1642 STM32 expansion board plugged on top of one NUCLEO-F401RE or NUCLEO-L053R8
